# PyJack

A Python recreation of blackjack, that is terminal based.

This game is mainly for learning purposes on my end, and it has certainly worked towards that end.

I use four libraries:

- Pynput.keyboard (handles most player input)
- Random (creates deck)
- Json (Game saving and loading)
- msvcrt (stdin clearing for pynput and base input() mixing)

This game is meant for Windows, Python 3.14.2

If you want to play PyJack, then launch the .py file, enter bet amount (cannot be 0 or a negative, or more than your currently held token amount).
You will gain back double your bet upon a win.

After making your bet, press "e" to hit, press "space" to stand, press "q" to double down.
